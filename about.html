<p>The Seven Deadly Sins is a manga series written and illustrated by Nakaba Suzuki, set in a fictitious Britannia in a time period superficially akin to the European Middle Ages. Likewise superficially, and frequently in ironic or contradictory ways, ..the series references widely varying traditions, including western Christianity (e.g., The Seven Deadly Sins, the Ten Commandments) and the Arthurian legend (e.g., in naming Meliodas, Escanor, Merlin, Diane, Gowther, King, and Ban.). The contradictory nature of the names given to the groups and characters is reflected in the emergence of the titular group as the protagonists and the group of "Holy Knights" as the antagonists of the series.
In accord with the medieval theme, many of The Seven Deadly Sins characters are depicted as types of knights, broadly construed, who are clad in stylized variations of medieval armor, many of whom perform magic. The members of the five clans in the series are Humans, Giants, Fairys, Gods, and Demons possess powerful abilities and magical prowess as well. In the naming of characters, the manga offers a wide variety of further mythical, historical, geographical and cultural allusions, including in the naming of Gowther, Zaratras, Dreyfus, Gustaf, Frisia, Jericho, Galand, Derierrie, Albions, The Vampires, and Zhivago.</p>
